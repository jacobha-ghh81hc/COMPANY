Hello everyone,
My name is jacob ha. Currently, I am an ABS/HAL developer working for Bosch Vietnam. That is the brake function of the ESP product to aid in the stability and steering ability while braking of modern cars.

This is the linux embedded system repository of ghh81hc.
It includes these source files targeting to Raspberry Pi 3B, mainly derived on Dr.Derek Molloy's book and other developers.
I'm cooking them for the academic purpose. So, welcome you!
